you can connect rows that are not the same size. they will get connected up until the shortest
row size. however, the longer row will remain intact which could cause some issues when printing
the board. when printing the board the do-while loop keeps checking if the next tile (the neighbour, 
so adjacent[2]) exists. for a row longer than the board, the tile will exist and some issues may arise.
moreover, those tiles (specifically the first tile that is overlength) will not correctly have some of their
neighbours set. within this game, it is not a problem, because all created rows have the same size.
