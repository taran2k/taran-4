# NOTE: spacing is for the space between the menus.
# NOTE: padding is for the space between the border and the menus.
# NOTE: the horizontal padding will always at least be padding_x,
# but could be more if the title is longer than the group width.
# NOTE: if no compact option is given, the first option will be used.
# NOTE: navigation keys shouldn't be the same as any other key.
# NOTE: navigation keys are case sensitive.
